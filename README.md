## ReplayGain Audio Normalization

Voidweaver automatically normalizes audio volume for consistent playback:

2. **Multiple Modes**:
   - **Track**: Each song at consistent volume
   - **Album**: Preserves album dynamics while normalizing overall level
3. **Real-time Adjustment**: Settings apply immediately to current playback
4. **Smart Fallback**: Handles files without metadata gracefully

Control your music from anywhere:

- **Lock Screen**: Full playback control with track info and album art
- **Notification Panel**: Persistent media controls in notification area
- **Bluetooth Devices**: Headphone buttons and car stereo controls
- **Background Playback**: Continues playing when app is backgrounded

## Troubleshooting

### **Connection Issues**

- Check username and password (no control characters allowed)
- Ensure server supports Subsonic API
- Make sure URL includes protocol and hostname

### **Audio Issues**
- **Volume too quiet/loud**: Adjust ReplayGain preamp setting

- **Inconsistent volume**: Use Track mode for consistent levels

### **Performance**
