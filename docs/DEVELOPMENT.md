## Development Patterns

- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Use Provider for state management
- Implement proper error boundaries

## Audio Service Integration

- Audio service initializes automatically when server is configured in AppState
- VoidweaverAudioHandler manages communication between AudioPlayerService and system controls
- MediaItem updates occur automatically when tracks change
- Graceful fallback ensures app works without native controls if initialization fails
- Import conflicts resolved using namespace aliases (audio_player_service.dart as aps)

## Android Configuration

### Audio Service Setup
The app uses `audio_service` package for native media controls, requiring specific Android configuration:

#### MainActivity.kt Configuration
```kotlin
package com.example.voidweaver

import com.ryanheise.audioservice.AudioServiceActivity

class MainActivity : AudioServiceActivity()
```

#### AndroidManifest.xml Permissions
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK" />
```

#### AndroidManifest.xml Service Configuration
```xml
<service android:name="com.ryanheise.audioservice.AudioService"
    android:foregroundServiceType="mediaPlayback"
    android:exported="true">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.media.browse.MediaBrowserService" />
    </intent-filter>
</service>

<receiver android:name="com.ryanheise.audioservice.MediaButtonReceiver"
    android:exported="true">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MEDIA_BUTTON" />
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>
```

### Key Configuration Files
- `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/example/voidweaver/MainActivity.kt` - AudioServiceActivity integration
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Permissions and service declarations

## Important Implementation Details

### Authentication
- Uses Subsonic API token-based authentication with salt/token generation
- Credentials stored securely using flutter_secure_storage with device encryption
- Automatic migration from legacy SharedPreferences storage
- Automatic re-authentication on app startup with comprehensive error handling

### Data Flow
1. App initializes through AppState.initialize()
2. Server credentials loaded from secure storage with automatic SharedPreferences migration
3. SubsonicApi configured for authenticated requests
4. AudioPlayerService created with ReplayGain integration
5. Native audio service initialized with VoidweaverAudioHandler for system media controls
6. Background sync timer started for album updates
7. UI reflects state changes through Provider notifications

## Requirements

- **Network Access**: Required for streaming music from your server and metadata extraction
- **Audio Playback**: Uses device audio capabilities with volume control for ReplayGain
- **Secure Storage**: Uses device-level encryption for login credentials and local storage for ReplayGain settings
- **HTTP Range Requests**: Server must support partial content requests for metadata extraction
