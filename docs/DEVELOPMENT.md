## Audio Service Integration

- Audio service initializes automatically when server is configured in AppState
- VoidweaverAudioHandler manages communication between AudioPlayerService and system controls
- MediaItem updates occur automatically when tracks change
- Graceful fallback ensures app works without native controls if initialization fails
- Import conflicts resolved using namespace aliases (audio_player_service.dart as aps)

## Advanced Skip Protection Architecture

### Problem Resolution
Completely resolved double-skip race conditions that occurred when multiple skip sources (manual controls, song completion events) executed simultaneously, especially on fast hardware.

### Comprehensive Solution Architecture

**Multi-Layer Protection System:**

1. **Operation-Level Locking**
   - `_skipOperationInProgress` flag prevents concurrent skip operations from any source
   - Immediate playback stop during manual skips prevents completion events
   - Global protection across UI controls, native controls, and auto-advance

2. **Dual Index Tracking**
   - `_currentIndex`: Working index during transitions
   - `_confirmedIndex`: Last confirmed playing track position
   - Auto-advance uses confirmed index to prevent race conditions

3. **Completion Event Protection**
   - `_lastCompletedSongId` prevents duplicate completion handling
   - Song completion events blocked during active skip operations
   - Proper cleanup of duplicate event listeners

4. **Comprehensive Logging**
   - 20-entry timestamped change log (`_indexChangeLog`)
   - Detailed operation source tracking for debugging
   - Index change validation with jump detection

5. **Atomic Operations**
   - Immediate audio stop before track changes
   - Sequential operation completion with proper state cleanup
   - Zone-safe error handling and resource management

**Protected Sources:**
- UI skip buttons and player controls
- Native media controls (headphones, lock screen, notifications)
- Automatic song completion events
- External device controls (Bluetooth, car systems)

This architecture ensures reliable single-track advancement regardless of timing, hardware speed, or operation source, completely eliminating double-skip behavior under all conditions.

## Android Configuration

### Audio Service Setup
The app uses `audio_service` package for native media controls, requiring specific Android configuration:

#### MainActivity.kt Configuration
```kotlin
package com.example.voidweaver

import com.ryanheise.audioservice.AudioServiceActivity

class MainActivity : AudioServiceActivity()
```

#### AndroidManifest.xml Permissions
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK" />
```

#### AndroidManifest.xml Service Configuration
```xml
<service android:name="com.ryanheise.audioservice.AudioService"
    android:foregroundServiceType="mediaPlayback"
    android:exported="true">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.media.browse.MediaBrowserService" />
    </intent-filter>
</service>

<receiver android:name="com.ryanheise.audioservice.MediaButtonReceiver"
    android:exported="true">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MEDIA_BUTTON" />
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>
```

### Key Configuration Files
- `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/example/voidweaver/MainActivity.kt` - AudioServiceActivity integration
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Permissions and service declarations

## Important Implementation Details

### Authentication
- Uses Subsonic API token-based authentication with salt/token generation
- Credentials stored securely using flutter_secure_storage with device encryption
- Automatic migration from legacy SharedPreferences storage
- Automatic re-authentication on app startup with comprehensive error handling

### Data Flow
1. App initializes through AppState.initialize()
2. Server credentials loaded from secure storage with automatic SharedPreferences migration
3. SubsonicApi configured for authenticated requests
4. AudioPlayerService created with ReplayGain integration
5. Native audio service initialized with VoidweaverAudioHandler for system media controls
6. Background sync timer started for album updates
7. UI reflects state changes through Provider notifications

## Requirements

- **Network Access**: Required for streaming music from your server and metadata extraction
- **Audio Playback**: Uses device audio capabilities with volume control for ReplayGain
- **Secure Storage**: Uses device-level encryption for login credentials and local storage for ReplayGain settings
- **HTTP Range Requests**: Server must support partial content requests for metadata extraction
