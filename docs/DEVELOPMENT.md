- Use debugPrint() for debug output
- Handle async operations with proper mounted checks

## Audio Service Integration

- **just_audio backend**: Migrated from audioplayers to just_audio for improved ExoPlayer integration and enhanced Bluetooth support
- **Dual State Architecture**: VoidweaverAudioHandler uses both AudioPlayerService state updates and direct just_audio PlayerState listening for reliable media controls
- **Skip State Masking**: During skip operations, masks transient paused states from audio_service to prevent Bluetooth control confusion
- **Audio Focus Optimization**: Removes interfering audio focus requests during skip operations to improve reliability
- Audio service initializes automatically when server is configured in AppState
- VoidweaverAudioHandler manages communication between AudioPlayerService and system controls using audio_service
- MediaItem updates occur automatically when tracks change
- PlayerState monitoring: Uses just_audio's playerStateStream for real-time state synchronization
- Graceful fallback ensures app works without native controls if initialization fails
- Import conflicts resolved using namespace aliases (audio_player_service.dart as aps)
- **Bluetooth Controls**: Skip operations now work reliably; minor play-after-pause issue remains (see [BLUETOOTH_CONTROLS.md](BLUETOOTH_CONTROLS.md) and TODO.md)

## Advanced Skip Protection Architecture

### Problem Resolution
Completely resolved double-skip race conditions that occurred when multiple skip sources (manual controls, song completion events) executed simultaneously, especially on fast hardware.

### Comprehensive Solution Architecture

**Multi-Layer Protection System:**

1. **Operation-Level Locking**
   - `_skipOperationInProgress` flag prevents concurrent skip operations from any source
   - Immediate playback stop during manual skips prevents completion events
   - Global protection across UI controls, native controls, and auto-advance

2. **Dual Index Tracking**
   - `_currentIndex`: Working index during transitions
   - `_confirmedIndex`: Last confirmed playing track position
   - Auto-advance uses confirmed index to prevent race conditions

3. **Completion Event Protection**
   - `_lastCompletedSongId` prevents duplicate completion handling from just_audio events
   - `_lastManualCompletedSongId` prevents duplicate manual completion handling
   - Song completion events blocked during active skip operations
   - **Manual completion fallback** with position-based detection (500ms tolerance) handles cases where just_audio completion events fail due to network buffering or codec timing issues
   - Proper cleanup of duplicate event listeners

4. **Comprehensive Logging**
   - 20-entry timestamped change log (`_indexChangeLog`)
   - Detailed operation source tracking for debugging
   - Index change validation with jump detection
   - Manual completion fallback logging with position and duration details

5. **Atomic Operations**
   - Immediate audio stop before track changes
   - Sequential operation completion with proper state cleanup
   - Zone-safe error handling and resource management

**Protected Sources:**
- UI skip buttons and player controls
- Native media controls (headphones, lock screen, notifications)
- Automatic song completion events
- External device controls (Bluetooth, car systems)

This architecture ensures reliable single-track advancement regardless of timing, hardware speed, or operation source, completely eliminating double-skip behavior under all conditions.

## Android Configuration

### Audio Service Setup
The app uses `audio_service` package for native media controls, requiring specific Android configuration:

#### MainActivity.kt Configuration
```kotlin
package com.example.voidweaver

import com.ryanheise.audioservice.AudioServiceActivity

class MainActivity : AudioServiceActivity()
```

#### AndroidManifest.xml Permissions
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK" />
```

#### AndroidManifest.xml Service Configuration
```xml
<service android:name="com.ryanheise.audioservice.AudioService"
    android:foregroundServiceType="mediaPlayback"
    android:exported="true">
